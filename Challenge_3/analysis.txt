1.SQL Injection Attempt:

The log entry GET /admin/remove_user?id=drop+database+users HTTP/1.0 suggests an SQL injection attempt. 
The query parameter id=drop+database+users is a strong indicator that an attacker is trying to manipulate backend database operations
through the website's input fields.

Recommendation: Sanitize and validate all inputs on the server side. Implement prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent 
SQL injection. Regularly audit and update the database management system (DBMS) and applications to patch known vulnerabilities.


2.Unauthorized Access Attempts:

The PUT /admin/remove_user HTTP/1.0 and DELETE /purchase HTTP/1.0 requests indicate attempts to access restricted areas of the website 
or perform unauthorized actions, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's logic or authentication mechanisms.

Recommendation: Strengthen authentication and authorization controls. Ensure that role-based access control (RBAC) is properly implemented. 
Consider adopting multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive areas of the website.

3.Potential DDoS Indicator:

Multiple requests from different IP addresses at the exact same timestamp 2024-01-24 15:18:48 +00:00 could indicate an attempt to overwhelm
the server, potentially part of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, especially if such patterns are frequent and voluminous over
a short period.
Recommendation: Implement rate limiting and request filtering. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and mitigate suspicious traffic 
patterns.Consider using DDoS protection services from cloud providers.
